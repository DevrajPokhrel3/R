# R Data Visualization Tutorial

## Overview
This is a collection of R scripts for learning basic data visualization techniques. The code covers various types of plots and charts commonly used in data analysis.

## What's Included

### Basic Plots
- Simple scatter plots with customization options
- Line plots and combination plots
- Plot formatting (colors, point styles, axis limits)

### Statistical Visualizations
- Box plots for distribution analysis
- Histograms with adjustable bins
- Bar plots for categorical data

### Advanced Visualizations using ggplot2
- Scatter plots with multiple variables
- Bar plots with grouping and stacking
- Faceted plots (multiple small plots)
- Heatmaps for matrix data

## Datasets Used
1. **Built-in R datasets**: `cars`, `iris`
2. **Custom data**: Requires a `home.csv` file in your working directory

## Packages Needed
- `ggplot2` - for advanced plotting
- `dplyr` - for data manipulation

## Basic Usage
1. Run the scripts in order from top to bottom
2. Make sure your data file (`home.csv`) is in the correct directory
3. Packages will install automatically if not present

## Learning Focus
- Understanding different plot types
- Customizing appearance (colors, labels, themes)
- Working with real datasets
- Creating publication-quality graphics

## Tips for Beginners
- Run code line by line to see what each part does
- Experiment with changing colors and parameters
- Check your working directory with `getwd()`
- View datasets with `View(dataset_name)` to understand the data

## Common Plot Types Covered
- Scatter plots
- Line charts  
- Box plots
- Histograms
- Bar charts
- Heatmaps

This collection is designed to help you practice and understand the fundamentals of data visualization in R!
